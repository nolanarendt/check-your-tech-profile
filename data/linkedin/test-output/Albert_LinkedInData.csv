A question raiser who loves to apply data in new and unconventional ways. With non-profit experience, I am driven by the constantly evolving needs of those around me to use data to improve the lives of those who need it most.  I have academic experience with R, SQL, and GIS, all of which I used for my senior thesis that explored how bike lanes can influence new business creation. Since graduating I have been seeking a job in data analytics while completing General Assemblyâ€™s Data Science Immersive program. Since starting this program I have become proficient in advanced data analysis techniques and python, git, Tableau, and more.

In carrying out this research, the results can help square the discussion of how bike infrastructure affects business health. Additionally, this research can assist cities in better deciding where to target new bike lane creation, as cities continue to solve congestion-related issues., This study quantifies the factors that may lead to a successful Kickstarter campaign. Using Kickstarter data and logit and linear probability models this analysis provides information on the factors that can increase the chance of a successful Kickstarter campaign. The factors included in this analysis include the type of campaign, posting date and time, funding goal, incentives, and other pieces making up Kickstarter campaigns. This research can provide concrete advice for those seeking to successfully fund a Kickstarter campaign., This analysis is used to gain a better understanding of the factors affecting the spread of COVID-19. This project explores the effects of 7 explanatory variables on the number of COVID-19 deaths in the United States using multiple linear regression. These 7 variables were chosen as literature on the topic has tended to find that these, and similar variables, were often the most important factors in determining the risk of COVID-19 spread. Additionally, the number of deaths appears to be the most accurate predictor of COVID-19 spread in the United States. Finally, this analysis is also concerned in finding if there is a disproportionate amount of deaths by COVID-19 for minority groups in the United States.","Tableau 2020 A-Z: Hands-On Tableau Training for Data Science, Complete Python Bootcamp: From Zero to Hero in Python, The Ultimate MySQL Bootcamp: Go from SQL Beginner to Expert"
