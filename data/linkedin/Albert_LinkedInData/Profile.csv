Albert,Frantz,,,Apr 5,2020 Economics Graduate  | Data Science Immersive Student | Data Scientist,"I am a detail-oriented data scientist that uses data as a language to understand the problems we face, from making cities more efficient to creating art. A question raiser who loves to apply data in new and unconventional ways. With non-profit experience, I am driven by the constantly evolving needs of those around me to use data to improve the lives of those who need it most.  I have academic experience with R, SQL, and GIS, all of which I used for my senior thesis that explored how bike lanes can influence new business creation. Since graduating I have been seeking a job in data analytics while completing General Assemblyâ€™s Data Science Immersive program. Since starting this program I have become proficient in advanced data analysis techniques and python, git, Tableau, and more.
